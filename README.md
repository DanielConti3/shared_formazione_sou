Introduction
============

This "secondary" branch is where my colleagues and I initially push scripts and files. We do this so we can modify and review them before
pushing them to the "main" branch of this repository.
This choice ensures the "main" branch remains clean and free from trivial mistakes like syntax and/or grammar errors.
