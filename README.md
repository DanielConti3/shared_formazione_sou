# Introduction
## DevOps Academy
My colleagues and I decided to make this repository to push exercises and activities we create together. Our intent was to have a shared repository where we could publish all the projects and materials we worked on as a team. With time, in this repo there will be added more folders, files and scripts regarding different concepts that we will work on during our DevOps Academy.
## Getting Started
> [!NOTE]
> Not all scripts were created to be foolproof, the exercises present on this repo are only for practising reasons, so when inserting inputs please be careful about what you are writing, since a wrong input might cause the scripts to break down.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To run all the scripts we highly suggest using either the `bash` or `sh` command.
 
An example could be:
```
bash game_library.sh
```
```
sh game_library.sh
```
# Projects
## Project I - Game library
In this project my colleague [Gabriele Ferri](https://github.com/Honoga-Sensei) and myself [Daniel Conti](https://github.com/DanielConti3) created a Steam-like game library where first you will be asked to create an account to then following up with a log-in. Afterwards you will have a few options to choose from:
- You can edit your game library either by adding or removing games.
- You can randomly select a game from said library so that you can start to play.
- You can do both, first editing and then selecting the game.
