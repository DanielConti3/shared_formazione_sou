# Introduction
## DevOps Academy
My colleagues and I decided to make this repository to push exercises and activities we create together. Our intent was to have a shared repository where we could publish all the projects and materials we worked on as a team. With time, in this repo there will be added more folders, files and scripts regarding different concepts that we will work on during our DevOps Academy.
## Getting Started
### To run the scripts we suggest using the following ways:
`bash game_library.sh`  
`sh game_library.sh`
# Projects
## Project I - Game library
In this project my colleague [Gabriele Ferri](https://github.com/Honoga-Sensei) and myself [Daniel Conti](https://github.com/DanielConti3) created a Steam-like game library where first you will be asked to create an account to then following up with a log-in. Afterwards you will have a few options to choose from:
- You can edit your game library either by adding or removing games.
- You can randomly select a game from said library so that you can start to play.
- You can do both, first editing and then selecting the game.
### To be noticed
Our intent when writing this script was to always have an option to retry to read the user input when a wrong one was inserted.

###### We thank anybody who is willing to add suggestions regarding our scripts ðŸ˜„
