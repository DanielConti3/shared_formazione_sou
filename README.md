# Introduction
## DevOps Academy
My colleagues and I decided to make this repository to push exercises and activities we create together. Our intent was to have a shared repository where we could publish all the projects and materials we worked on as a team. With time, in this repo there will be added more folders, files and scripts regarding different concepts that we will work on during our DevOps Academy.
