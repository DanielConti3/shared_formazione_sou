# Introduction
## DevOps Academy
My colleagues and I decided to make this repository to push exercises and activities we create together. Our intent was to have a shared repository where we could publish all the projects and materials we worked on as a team. With time, in this repo there will be added more folders, files and scripts regarding different concepts that we will work on during our DevOps Academy.
## Getting Started
> [!NOTE]
> Not all scripts were created to be foolproof, some of them are simply made to express a concept or try some commands.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All scripts were created using bash (Bourne Again SHell), so use `bash` or `sh` to execute them.

An example could be:
```
bash Script-0.sh
```
```
sh Script-0.sh
```
